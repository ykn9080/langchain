He meets Max Demian, who helps him to understand the importance of self-reliance and the power of his own ideas. Through Demian's influence, the protagonist learns to accept his place in the world and to embrace his own unique story. Along the way, he meets Pistorius, who teaches him about Abraxas, and Eva, Demian's mother, who encourages him to find his dream and remain faithful to it. When war is declared, Sinclair goes to the front and finds something akin to humanity beneath the surface of the war. In the end, he finds comfort in the knowledge that his own image now resembles his friend and leader.\""
